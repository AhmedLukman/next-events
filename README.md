##About

This is a front-end only Next Js TypeScript mini project that is about technology events, including event date, summary etc Since no backend code is present, data is saved via state temporarily.

This project manages login and event detail states using redux and redux toolkit. 

##Getting started

Clone this project to your github repository and run 'npm i' to install the dependancies included in this project. Then run npm run dev to run this in your localhost.

Thank you very much for taking your time to review my sample project.
